# React + Vite

This template sets up a basic environment to start working with React in Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint configurations.

Currently, two official plugins are supported:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Utilizes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
